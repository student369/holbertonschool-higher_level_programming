# Python 3 Almost a circle

A project to review all the previous concepts
to get better understanding of how to program
in Python 3.

This project contains the following files:

| File or Folder | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| tests | A folder with the unittest cases to this project. |
| models/base.py (I), models/__init__.py | A base class and an empty file. |
| models/rectangle.py (I) | A Rectangle class that inherit of the base class |
| models/rectangle.py (II) | An update to the Rectangle class with validations, setters and instantiation |
| models/rectangle.py (III) | An update to the Rectangle class with public method. |
| models/rectangle.py (IV) | An update to the Rectangle class with a public method. |
| models/rectangle.py (V) | An update to the Rectangle class applying polimorfms to the string definition. |
| models/rectangle.py (VI) | An update to the Rectangle class with a modification to the second public method. |
| models/rectangle.py (VII) | An update to the Rectangle class with a third public class. |
| models/rectangle.py (VIII) | An update to the Rectangle public class update with the prototype modifyed. |
| models/square.py (I) | A Square class inherit of Rectangle class. |
| models/square.py (II) | An update to the Square class with the getter and setter. |
| models/square.py (III) | An update to the Rectangle class with an update public method. |
| models/rectangle.py (IX) | An update to the Rectangle class with an aditional method called to_dictionary. |
| models/square.py (III) | An update to the Square class with an aditional method called to_dictionary. |
| models/base.py (II) | An update to the Base class with an static method called to_json_string. |
| models/base.py (III) | An update to the Base class with a class method called save_to_file. |
| models/base.py (IV) |  An update to the Base class with a static method called from_json_string. |
| models/base.py (V) |  An update to the Base class with a class method called create. |
