This module is very simple, since it only has one function called
``text_indentation()`` that prints the text splited in new lines
the . ? or : symbols.

``text_indentation()`` returns nothing

::
    >>> text_indentation = __import__("5-text_indentation").text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation(".")
    .
    <BLANKLINE>
    >>> text_indentation("?")
    ?
    <BLANKLINE>
    >>> text_indentation(":")
    :
    <BLANKLINE>
